There are 2 versions of m2root. Both use the standard MCEEP ntuple
e.g. mceep.ntu and convert it to a root ntuple (be carful a root
ntuple can only have about t 14 entries.

m2root: assumes mceep.ntu as name for the mceep ntuple Make a
symbolic link to the real ntuple you wand to convert. The result of
m2root is then a file called mceep.root.

m2root_stdin: reads the mceep ntuple from stdin and creates then the
mceep.root file.

Both programs need the file m2root.h which contains the connection
between the variable numbers and the variable names. This file is
created from the common file var_dat.cmn in the mceep distribution. To
create m2root.h make a symbolic link named var_dat.cmn that points to
the real file var_dat.cmn which usually is located in the cmn
directory. Then run the python script 

prep_m2root.py 

This reads var_dat.cmn and writes m2root.h. After this you can compile
and link m2root with the command:
make -f m2root.mak
