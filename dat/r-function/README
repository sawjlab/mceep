The files here are the new LeRose ones, which he calls
New-Left and New-Right.  I have renamed the directories
so that I don't have to change the Fortran code which
directly references these directory names.  The old files
have been put into old.tar.  According to LeRose, the
function files (i.e. Fortran) have not changed so that only
the data files contained here were extracted from his new
distribution:  http://www.jlab.org/~lerose/r-function.html
