                         ---------------------

     Various directories will be created when you build MCEEP.  They are:


   Source directories
   ------------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/sources/
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/gross/
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/cosy/
   Contains:        All Fortran sources.and objects
                    In addition, ~/mceep/sources contains the executable.

   Input directory
   ---------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/input/
   Contains:        The standard input file is located here.  Also, to test
                    the program, output files for the standard input file
                    are located here.  You should run the program with
                    the sample input file and compare these outputs with
                    the ones you generated.

   Output directory
   ----------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/output/
   Contains:        The compare script will place output files for the
                    standard input file here.   Starting with version 3.0
                    the output will be located wherever the program is run. 

   Data directory
   --------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/dat/
   Contains:        All data files (spectral functions, etc.)
                    will be located here.  Also the random number seed
                    files are located here.

   Common directory
   ----------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/cmn/
   Contains:        The common block modules which are included
                    in various Fortran sources will be located here.

   Utilities directory
   -------------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/utilities/
   Contains:        The mceep companion program, mceep_util, is located
                    here.  It is compiled and linked separately.
                    This program can convert mceep histograms (Topdrawer
                    format) and Ntuples to HBOOK format.  A separate script
                    located here (make_hbook) can be used to make
                    a single .hbook file from all the Topdrawer histos
                    by scanning the mceep input file for requested plots.

   Systematic errors directory
   ---------------------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/systerr/
   Contains:        A set of tools for analyzing kinematics related
                    systematic uncertainties.  See the README file.
                    The Fortran code is compiled and linked separately.

   Distribution directory
   ----------------------
   Unix name:       ~/mceep/distribute/
   Contains:        The MCEEP distribution kit.



   A sample input file called v3_9.inp should be located in the input   
   directory.  See the file input.f for the format of MCEEP
   input files. The results obtained by MCEEP using v3_9.inp as input (for
   the bound state case in (e,e'p) with radiative effects, multi-photon
   correction, photon cutoff energy of 1 MeV, physics
   option 200 and spectral function 10) are located in the input
   directory as well.  These files provide a comparison so that you can
   verify that the program is working properly.

   To verify the port of mceep, you can execute the script:
   /mceep/utilities/compare_v3_9.   This script will run mceep with
   the v3_9.inp input file and compare the output generated with that
   from your distribution.

   To produce .hbook files (for use with PAW, PAW++), see the description
   of the utilities directory above.  To make HBOOK files from a set
   of MCEEP topdrawer files/ntuples requires executing only one command
   ("~/mceep/utilities/make_hbook mceep_input_file_prefix").  This command
   should be typed from the directory containing your input and output. 

   NOTE:  The calculations for the single-arm cross sections ((e,e'),
          (e,p) etc.) which are based on the programs of J.W. Lightbody
          and J.S. O'Connell (see Computers in Physics, May/June 1988,
          p. 57) are currently too slow to be practical for a large
          number of events (especially the (e,p) calculation).
          I hope to make faster parameterizations of these cross
          sections available in the future.  For the time being,
          unless you are specifically interested in examining single-arm
          yields, it is suggested that the program be run without
          calculating the single-arm cross sections (just answer "N" to
          the appropriate question when running the program).

          For (e,e'p), the following singles cross sections are calculated:
                (e,e'), (e,pi-), (e,p) and (e,pi+)
          For (e,e'n), the following singles cross sections are calculated:
                (e,e'), (e,pi-), (e,n) and (e,pi0)

          Finally, physics option 300 for deuterium is explicitly for (e,e'p)
          whether (e,e'p) or (e,e'n) is specified at runtime.  The
          formalism on which this option is based (from Dmitrasinovic/Gross)
          has not been fully tested - so beware!

       November 22, 1991          CHANGES SINCE PRELIMINARY DISTRIBUTION:

       1) MCEEP now has an elastic scattering option.  This can be used,
          for example, to simulate 1H(e,e'p) elastic scattering.  Although
          the kinematics are general so that, in principle, one can
          simulate any elastic A(e,e'A) process, currently the only
          physics model implemented is for hydrogen.  Both cross sections
          and polarizations as well as the parity violating asymmetry
          are calculated.  The parity-violating asymmetry is for
          the scattering of polarized electrons off protons in a simple
          model (see the comments in hyd_elastic.for for more
          details).  The partial yield can be examined by specifying
          an IPID index of 8.  The index -8 allows the actual asymmetry
          to be examined (which includes a factor for the polarization
          of the beam).

       2) Displayed coincidence cross sections are now differential
          in the hadron momentum, instead of energy (for the continuum
          case).  The cross sections are differential in momentum
          since it is the momentum which is randomly sampled.

       3) A minor error was corrected in converting the sampled angles
          to laboratory angles.  This correction produces a uniform
          sampling of solid angle as is required.  This will only make
          a difference for VERY large solid angle acceptances.  For
          an 8 msr solid angle, for example, the effect is negligible.

       4) Additional harmonic oscillator momentum distributions are now
          provided.

       5) Several additional options are now provided for describing the
          spectrometers + detectors.  These are DFT, ROT and POL.
             DFT:  performs a drift in a field-free region.
             ROT:  expresses the Transport vector in a rotated coordinate
                   system.  This only works for field free regions since
                   the rays are traced to the new coordinate system.
             POL:  performs first order spin precession through a magnetic
                   element.  Assumes that the precession angle depends only
                   on the net bend angle for that element.

       6) For bound state calculations (where the hadron final momentum
          is calculated from the electron kinematics, the hadron emission
          angles and the missing mass) there are, in general, two
          roots for the hadron momentum.  These correspond to emission
          of the hadron along or against q in the final COM system.
          Previously, one of the roots was ignored.  This has been
          fixed, so that now both roots are considered when they are
          both within the hadron-arm momentum acceptance.

       7) An additional physics model (option 500) has been incorporated.
          This model calculates pion electroproduction from the proton
          in p(e,e'p)pi0 and is based on the routines of R. Lourie.

       8) An error in the handling of extended targets (which affected
          only the spectrometer map) has been corrected.
          Now the particle trajectory is traced from the interaction
          point to the standard Transport XY plane whose origin is at
          the target center.  This is necessary if one wishes to apply
          a Transport matrix to examine various quantities at the focal
          plane, for instance.

       9) The random number functions in random.for were previously
          single precision.  However, they were implicitly assumed to
          be double precision in the calling routines.  Apparently,
          this was no problem for VMS but had SERIOUS consequences for
          the ULTRIX version.  The functions are now double precision.

      10) MCEEP can now handle spectrometers with an arbitrary bend
          plane orientation.

      11) NOTE:  The input file structure has changed slightly.  For
          instance, now all masses are entered on one line, including the
          ejectile mass.  See the file input.for for the exact structure
          of the input file.

      12) For factorized (e,e'N) the spectral function routines have been
          cleaned up.  In particular, the momentum distributions are now
          truncated where their behavior becomes unreasonable.
          Interpolations on momentum distributions now take the form
          exp(Ap^2 +Bp + C) instead of Ap^2 + Bp + C.  Finally the
          spectroscopic factor now applies to all spectral functions
          as an overall multiplicative factor.  The integrals of the
          various distributions can be found in the routines contained
          in spectral.for.  Finally, the topdrawer files deut_mceep.top,
          he3_mceep.top and he4_mceep.top illustrate most of the
          momentum distributions used by MCEEP.  These files can be found
          in ~/mceep/dat/.


                        CHANGES SINCE Version 1.0
                        -------------------------

          Version 1.10 / 08-AUG-1992
                 Track reconstruction option added.
                 Calculation of accidentals added.
                 2nd order TRANSPORT added.
                 Time-of-Flight histogram added.


                        CHANGES SINCE Version 1.10
                        --------------------------

                   (See Comments in the file mceep.f
                   for names of added/changed modules)

          Version 1.20 / 28-OCT-1992
                 Fixed portability problem involving variable format
                     descriptors.  Removing variable descriptors
                     required adding a subroutine to extract the
                     character data at the end of an input line.
                 Dipole nucleon form factors now used throughout.
                 GEn now has "correct" asymptotic form.
                 Uniform random numbers now generated by RANECU
                     rather than RAN function.
                 Only a single pair of initial seeds are now required
                     rather than using different initial seeds for
                     different variables.
                 Initial seeds set by default or from a file
                     (DAT$D:seeds_start.dat).  The final seeds are
                     written to a file (DAT$D:seeds_end.dat) to allow
                     adding results of successive runs of MCEEP.

                        CHANGES SINCE Version 1.20
                        --------------------------

                   (See Comments in the file mceep.f
                   for names of added/changed modules)

          Version 2.0 / 07-OCT-1994
                 Added N-Tuple option to allow replaying MCEEP
                     data with PAW.  Currently, a file is written
                     which then needs to be reformatted (outside
                     MCEEP) for PAW.

                        CHANGES SINCE Version 2.0
                        -------------------------

                   (See Comments in the file mceep.f
                   for names of added/changed modules)

          Version 2.1 / 10-SEP-1997
           (Some of these changes have already been included in an unofficial
            release - these are marked with an *)
                 ELECTRO_PROD has been modified
                     since previously a factor of i was missing
                     from the born terms and the polarization
                     observables were never boosted from the COM
                     frame to the LAB frame.
                 * Physics option 300 (d(e,e'p)n Gross/Van Orden)
                     has been updated.
                 * Option to bypass spectrometer traceback included
                     so that cross sections and derived kinematics
                     are calculated from the original coordinates.
                 PEEPI has been modified to include boost to LAB frame.

          Version 2.2 / 24-APR-1998
                 No longer supports DEC-VMS platform
                 Now supports Linux (Absoft f77) platform

          Version 2.3 / 23-APR-1999
                 Deuteron paris wave function added
                 JLAB-Hall A spectrometers added via routines of J. LeRose


                        CHANGES SINCE Version 2.3
                        -------------------------

                   (See comments in the file mceep.f
                   for names of added/changed modules
                   as well as names of contributors.)

          Version 3.0 / 14-SEP-1999
                 Added radiative effects, both internal and external
                 Added realistic ionization energy loss/multiple scattering
                 Added target models:  Single foil or multiple foils
                                       JLAB Hall A cryotarget (LH2/LD2)
                 Added (e,e'K+)Lambda physics option
                 Files now opened with STATUS='UNKNOWN' so that
                     successive runs can be done without deleting previous
                     files.  Of course, now there is a risk of overwriting
                     the old files (nothing's perfect).
                 Input and output are now located in the directory
                     from where the program is run (i.e. these directories
                     are no longer hardwired to mceep/input and mceep/output).

          Version 3.1 / 18-NOV-1999
                 
                 JLAB-Hall A tuna can target model (3,4He) added.
                 3He elastic scattering option added (A. Deur).
                 Beam raster option added (F. Sabatie).
                 LeRose electron arm inverse functions updated.
                 "Bowtie" effect now corrected after applying
                     LeRose inverse functions.
                 Now allows option of including the multi-photon
                     correction to the radiative tail (J. Templon
                     et al. method).
                 Photon cutoff energy is now read in instead of
                     hardwired to 1 MeV (1 MeV is the default though).
                 Bug fixes in energy loss routines for either
                     non-standard target nuclei or neutral ejectiles
                     (now neutral ejectiles have no mult. scatt. or
                      energy loss - a "cheap" fix).
                 Bug fix for missing mass, since for VCS half the
                     events are thrown out as non-physical due to
                     roundoff/resolution effects.
                 Bug fix for spectrometer options.  Now, TRK,
                     MAT, ROT, DFT and TOF are only called for
                     kinematics (ICALL=2).  This is necessary for
                     consistency among all these options.  This
                     bug has been known to lead to serious errors
                     when the TRK and HRS options are combined.
                 Bug fix for file names.  Now accomodates longer
                     paths/names.
                 Bug fixes for p(e,e'K) - physics option 700.
                 Bug fix:  avg. cross section in summary file
                     used to be calculated by taking phase space
                     weighted sum of sigma divided by sum of unity
                     for each event.  Now I correctly divide by
                     sum of phase space (with radiation this can
                     make a BIG difference).
                 Bug fix:  for radiative tail, the unradiated
                     cross section in Mo/Tsai and Borie/Drechsel
                     should be calculated using vertex kinematics.
                     This was done, except that the beam energy
                     and scattered electron energy were the
                     asymptotic values.  Now everything is vertex.
                 Bug fix:  for LH2/LD2 target and spectrometer angles
                     between -90 and -180 deg, the target path (for
                     energy loss calculation) was incorrect.
                     This fix was incorporated after initial release.
                 Bug fix:  for Meier-Hadjuk 3He spectral function
                     events with recoil momentum between 0 and 5 MeV/c
                     were thrown out.  Now the spectral function at
                     5 MeV/c is used for all momenta in this range.
                     This fix was incorporated after initial release.
                 Bug fix:  schwinger routine converted Q^2 from
                     (GeV/c)^2 to (MeV/c)^2 by mult. by 10^3 instead
                     of 10^6.
                     This fix was incorporated after initial release.
                 Now calculate focal plane vector even if event fails
                     the aperture cuts (hrs.f).  This makes the before
                     cuts counters physically meaningful.
                     This fix was incorporated after initial release.

          Version 3.2     29-DEC-1999
                 Bug fix for eloss_proton.f:  emax was calculated
                     from variables with incompatible energy scales.
                 Improvement of denscorr.f:  C0 now corrected for
                     difference in A as well as density.  Also
                     corrected two bug fixes in denscorr.
                 Added Salme 3He(e,e'p) spectral function.
                 Added kinematics variables:
                     components of PREC in LAB system
                     energy loss variables
                 Now specify object point of each spectrometer
                     allowing for possible mispointings.
                     The BEAM_E1-BEAM_P3 coordinates now refer
                     to the vertex coordinates in a modified LAB
                     system with new origin at the object point.
                     VERTEX_X-Z refer to the actual vertex
                     coordinates in the unmodified LAB system.
                 Incorporate ejectile spin precession via COSY
                     spin matrix (Mark Jones).  Also produce
                     output for helicity dependent and helicity
                     independent pieces of each polarization
                     component (Mark Jones).

          Version 3.3     22-FEB-2000
                 Allow for beam centroid offsets.
                     Also account for these offsets in the
                     case of target foils at non-zero angle.
                 Allow for smearing of beam position with gaussian.
                 Allow Kinematics Ntuples to include initial and
                     final Transport coordinates.  This allows
                     regular kinematic quantities to be cut
                     on these variables via Ntuples.
                 Increase maximum # variables per Ntuple
                     from 20 to 100.
                 Increase maximum # of elements per spectrometer
                     from 30 to 50.
                 Fixed bug in beam dE/dx correction (previously
                     there was NO CORRECTION due to bug).
                 Set focal plane vector to zero for events
                     which fail HRS apertures.  This avoids
                     numerical errors on some platforms.  The
                     eloss/mscatt routines occasionally give
                     large effects for ray coordinates and
                     the LeRose inverse functions are not
                     designed to deal with events way outside
                     the acceptance.  Note that these events
                     fail the cuts anyway.
                 Modified 3He elastic routine (D. Higinbotham).
                 Added Tritium, 4He and 12C elastic
                     routines (D. Higinbotham).
                 Modified nuclear masses in mceep.f (D. Higinbotham).

          Version 3.4     13-APR-2000
                 Fixed "bowtie" correction and also correct for
                     explicit X0 due to vertical raster,
                     spectrometer mispointing, etc.
                     Also, now one can use the "electron"
                     spectrometer or "hadron" spectrometer
                     for detection of either particle.
                 GEP (for FFTYPE='DIPOLE') now employs fit to
                     JLAB-Hall A GEP/GMP ratio in E93027
                     (GMP is taken to be standard dipole
                     form factor times MUP)
                     (S. Dieterich/S. Strauch).
                 Several new deuteron momentum distributions
                     from Sabine Jeschonnek: Bonn, Argonne V18,
                     CD Bonn, Gross/Van Orden.
                 Now allow histogramming of focal plane coords.
                     in addition to coords. before and after
                     call to SPECTROMETER.
                 MCEEP now beeps when it finishes (just like
                     ESPACE - amazing).
                 Routines SPLINE and SPLINT in wave.f renamed
                     to GROSS_SPLINE and GROSS_SPLINT to avoid
                     conflict with routines of EPIPROD (J.J. Kelly)
                     with same names.
                 Add histograms/ntuples of various kinematical
                     quantities defined with respect to the
                     virtual photon vertex (as opposed to the
                     normally measured kinematical quantities
                     which reflect radiation).
                 Incorporate LeRose's new forward functions which
                     have improved x0 dependence.
                 Increased precision for Ntuple write statement.
                 Fixed bug in elossw where the energy loss in the
                     endcap (for target model=2) was negative
                     for abs(proton_angle)>90.
                 Added components of polarizations in scattering
                     plane (total, hel. dep. and hel. indep.)
                     (S. Strauch); changed tag for electron
                     analyzing power from 8 to 11.

          Version 3.5     07-NOV-2000
                 Incorporated Arenhoevel interpolated response
                     functions for d(e,e'p)n.
                 Added multiple weight Ntuple ('NTM').
                 Changed REAL-->DREAL in deut_sabjes.f to fix
                     problems with g77 compiler (K. Fissum, 
                     S. Jeschonnek).  Also fixed bug in get_deut_bonn
                     (removed the argument list).
                     These changes were made after
                     the original distribution of Version 3.5
                     (on 01-FEB-2001).
                 Added angles of recoil momentum vector in LAB.
                     This change was made after the original release of
                     Version 3.5 (on 07-FEB-2001). 
                 Fixed bug in targ_geom.f.  The solid angle Jacobian
                     had an error (pointed out by Marat Rvachev).
                     This error is very small in most cases
                     (much less than 1%).
                     This change was made after the original release of
                     Version 3.5 (on 13-MAR-2001). 
                 Added modification of make_hbook script since on some
                     systems indentation of one of the temporary files
                     seems to be a problem (modification by Zhengwei Chai
                     on 11-APR-2001).
                 Added spectral functions for 16O from Udias and
                     for 208Pb from Lapikas.  These were all
                     coded by K. Fissum.  (16-APR-2001).

          Version 3.6     28-JUN-2001

                 Allow histogramming of X and Y at HRS apertures.
                 Changed default Q3 radius for HRS from 0.30 m
                 Get arenhoevel responses from directory defined
                     by environment variable mceep_aren
                 Added JLAB-HRS R-functions of J. LeRose. 
                     Also included new routine in mceep_util to 
                     add R-function values to exising
                     data N-tuples. (Mark Jones coded this with 
                     some modifications from me.)  This allows comparing 
                     data and MCEEP with same R-function cuts.
                 Fixed bug:  for energy loss with dE/dx correction
                     the acceptances were enforced after making
                     this correction, whereas they are now
                     enforced prior to dE/dx correction.
                 Include updated p(e,e'K) routine from P. Markowitz

          Version 3.7     03-MAY-2002

                 Now runs on SGI operating system (thanks to Steve Wood).
                 Nucleon form factor routine, formfact.f, now
                     refers to standard dipole as FFTYPE='DIPOLE',
                     whereas the Hall A Fit to GE/GM is given by
                     FFTYPE='HALLA1' (uses dipole GMp).  Another
                     fit was also added called 'HALLA2' which
                     uses alternate extraction of GMp and also the 
                     Hall A GE/GM ratio to get GEp.  A third
                     fit called 'HALLA3' (now the default)
                     uses an alternate MMD form factor for GMp
                     and the Hall A GE/GM ratio to get GEp.
                     Other parametrizations added too.
                 New LeRose transfer functions (forward and
                     reverse) and new r-functions (data files
                     only).
                 Added Hall A MAD spectrometer (K. McCormick).
                 Added Hall A polarized 3He target (K. McCormick).
                 Contains a set of tools to analyze kinematic related 
                     sytematic uncertainties.

          Version 3.7  (update) 27-SEP-2002

                 An option within mceep_util to add r-functions
                     to ESPACE generated HBOOK column-wise Ntuples 
                     (see the file ~/mceep/utilities/README_CWN 
                     for details). 

          Version 3.8     24-APR-2003
                 COSY model of JLab Hall A HRS (adapted from
                     Hall C program, SIMC) added (W. Hinton).
                 Small change made in r-function.f 
                     (both in sources and in utilities directories) 
                     allowing the program to compile on Sun
                     systems.
                 Fixed bug in tg_path.f

          Version 3.9     03-AUG-2005
                 Added calculation of x_tg(5) in hrs_inv.f.  
                     Also, now use this information to get the 
                     interaction point in the target as seen
                     by the spectrometers. (i.e. the BEAM_E1, BEAM_E2 
                     and BEAM_E3 variables now refer to the interaction
                     point, rather than the point where the particle 
                     intersects the target Transport (Z=0) plane.
                     Same for proton variables).
                 For the case of foils, the various walls were not
                     handled properly in energy loss routines. There were 
                     several bugs, now fixed.
                 The formatting of the cosy source files has been 
                     standardized for compatibility with the latest 
                     ABSOFT compiler (W. Boeglin).
                 Added bremsstrahlung routine for elastic ep by
                     Florian Weissbach and Kai Hencken.
                 Added deForest sigma_CC2 offshell cross section (P. Monaghan).
                 Added cigar tube LH2/LD2 target (H. Ibrahim).
                 Added MAD 12 degree configs. (standard and no quad tunes).
                 Added MCEEP Ntuple to ROOT file conversion (W. Boeglin).
                 Modified ~/mceep/utilities/make_hbook so that temporary 
                     files have unique names (associated with input file 
                     names).  This allows running several mceep scripts 
                     simultaneously without file conflicts (H. Ibrahim).
                 Now allow for calculation of spectrometer acceptance 
                     functions (must bypass kinem in case of failure there).
                 Fixed bug:  Window energy loss was doubly included!
                 Fixed some portability issues with Sun-OS.
                 Fixed bug in c12_elastic routine (R. Feuerbach).
                 Fixed bug in harmonic oscillator momentum distributions
                     as the model numbers were incorrect.
                 Added option to correct for most probable energy
                     loss (mean energy loss correction was only
                     option before)
                 Added Laget grid for d(e,e'p) (E. Voutier/P. Ulmer).
                 Added the septum optics model ala' J. LeRose.
                     Should be analogous to HRS model (P. Markowitz)
