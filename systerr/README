      Kinematic Related Systematic Error Evaluation Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains tools to analyze systematic errors
in conjunction with MCEEP.  MCEEP must first be run to output
an Ntuple of the Transport vectors (see the test input located
here:  "trvec.inp").

Note that the code systerr will not deal with radiative effects
but assumes the errors can be calculated from the unradiated
cross sections.  Therefore, you should run MCEEP without 
radiation.

There are three main utilities in this directory:

1) systerr:  a Fortran code which should be run to generate a 
   new Ntuple from the MCEEP Ntuple.  The new Ntuple is a copy
   of the original but also includes cross sections for 1 mr
   or 10^-3 shifts of each of the nine kinematic variables
   (3 beam, 3 scattered electron, 3 ejectile).
2) systerr.kumac:  a PAW kumac file which will display the cross 
   section fractional derivatives (in units of /mr, /10^-3).
   This kumac should be run after the Fortran code, systerr, in
   order to generate event-averaged vectors of the cross sections
   for each of the different offsets.
3) toterr:  a Fortran code which will generate the total error
   from the vectors produced by systerr.kumac.

Instructions to execute the test case, located here, follow.
Everything below assumes you installed MCEEP from your 
topmost directory.

0) You should set your working directory to "~/mceep/systerr".
1) First run mceep to generate the input hbook file 
   with the Transport vectors.  You can do this with:
   "~/mceep/sources/mceep < mceep_control"
2) Next generate the hbook file from the mceep output.
   "~/mceep/utilities/make_hbook trvec"
3) Now run the systerr code.
   "./systerr < systerr_control"
4) Process the resulting hbook file (trvec_err.hbook) and
   examine the results in PAW (after opening the hbook file):
   PAW> exec systerr
   Before hitting RET to get the total error, do step 5.
5) Run the toterr code:
   "./toterr"
    "errmat.inp"
6) PAW> RET

The result of step 4 will be a 3x3 panel figure with the top row for
the beam uncertainties, the middle for the scattered electron
and the bottom for the ejectile.  The left column is for 10^-3
shifts of the momenta, the middle column is for 1 mr shifts
of the in-plane angles and the right column is for 1 mr shifts
of the out-of-plane angles.

The result of step 6 will be a single plot of the total (quadrature
sum) error vs. the kinematic variable specified in systerr.kumac.
You can change the histogram limits/channel numbers by editing the top
lines of "systerr.kumac".

Have fun!
